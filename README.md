## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to use front-end technologies to create an interactive application for blowing up a balloon. 

## Application Features
* Blow up the balloon by physically blowing near your machine's microphone

## Tools and Techniques
Technologies used include:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Implementation Details
The application was implemented in Visual Studio Code, utilizing audio input to sense blow intensity.

## Run
To run the application follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the applications `server` folder on your computer
3. Run the following command in the terminal: `node app`
    * Note: if you do not have npm or node installed, visit `www.npmjs.com` to download
4. Open a web browser and type in `localhost:3000/index.html`


## Creating The Code
To create the code I followed the below steps using Github, NodeJS and Express:
1. Create a new Github repository, and copy the HTTPS URL.
2. Navigate to the location you would like the repository on your machine. Run the command in the terminal `git clone <HTTPS_URL>`
3. Open the folder in a text editor (I used VS Code)
4. Create a new folder `server`
5. Inside `server`, create a new file called `app.js`, and a new folder called `public`
6. Navigate to the new `server` folder in your terminal using `cd` and type the following commands:
    * `npm init --y`
    * `npm i express`
7. Once the application is coded and you want to serve the application, follow the instructions above in `Run` section
